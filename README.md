# CS-370

For this project, I worked on developing an intelligent agent—the pirate—for a treasure hunt game using deep Q-learning. I was given two support files. TreasureMaze.py: This defined the environment, representing the maze as a matrix. GameExperience.py: This handled experience replay by storing episodes of gameplay data. The Jupyter notebook was also partially pre-populated to guide the implementation. I implemented the Q-learning logic in the qtrain() function, designed the training loop, managed exploration/exploitation via an epsilon-greedy strategy, and used experience replay for model updates. I also integrated logging for performance tracking and tested the agent in different maze configurations.

Computer scientists design and develop algorithms, software, and systems that solve real-world problems. They create technologies that drive innovation. Their work matters because it shapes how we interact with information and automate complex tasks, leading to increased efficiency, accessibility, and capabilities. I approach problems by: analyzing the requirements and constraints of the system, designing modular and scalable solutions using algorithms and data structures, implementing solutions in a chosen programming language, testing and refining through debugging, simulations, and user feedback, optimizing for performance and maintainability. This structured approach helps break down complex tasks into manageable steps. I have ethical responsibilities that include: protecting user privacy and ensuring data security, building inclusive, unbiased systems that do not discriminate or harm, being transparent about system capabilities and limitations, prioritizing safety and reliability, especially in systems that affect health, finance, or public welfare, maintaining integrity, avoiding plagiarism, and giving credit for collaborative work.
